      "message": "I don\u0027t really have a problem with the concept of grabbing information from the kernel and putting it on dbus, but this does not have anything to do with u-boot-env-mgr. It seems like this new service should be in its own repo or in entity manager itself. Not sure where it should land, but not here. Maybe similar to openpower-vpd-parser, there should be an hpe-vpd-parser repo.",
