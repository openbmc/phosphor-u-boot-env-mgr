I had the impression there was not when I searched @ github.com/openbmc/openbmc for references to it.\n\nIf I\u0027m remembering right, I ended up creating a recipe from scratch on my machine so I could \u0027devtool modify\u0027 and build the repo with CMakeLists -- then changed it to use meson and confirmed it worked before pushing this commit to Gerrit.\n\nI figured the meson recipe I put together would be the last thing pushed (once the meson changes to this repo are accepted), since a recipe for this repo doesn\u0027t exist yet and isn\u0027t referenced by any existing platforms in openbmc/openbmc as far as I know.",
